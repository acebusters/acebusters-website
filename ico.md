<h2>How our ICO works</h2>

During our ICO we will sell our token, called Nutz,  in exchange for Ether, the currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Nutz are used to play at the tables and later for tournament buy-ins or deploying your own tables. They are the foundation of the Acebusters economy.
Then there is the Acebusters Power Token (ABP). It represents a share in our economy. We will give away 20% of shares after the ICO has ended. Everybody who purchased Nutz can then convert them into the equivalent share of ABP.
ABPs are not transferable but can be converted back to Nutz. ABPs cannot be used to play at the tables or make any transactions in the economy. They do however represent voting rights. For example the amount of rake taken and the share we give back to the players and affiliates (rakeback) will be up for vote on a regular basis. We use ABP to bind capital. Therefore it takes 3 months to convert ABPs back to Nutz. Where each month ⅓ of the amount of Nutz is transferred back to the users wallet.

<h2>Roles</h2>

The investors: Everybody who buys Nutz during the ICO. A total share of 20% of Acebusters Power Token will reserved for investors.
The Founders: The Founders will hold 40% of the ABPs after the ICO. Because ABPs cannot quickly be transferred back to Nutz their capital is bound.
Sales Admins: A group which oversees the ICO. They will act as escrows for the remaining 40% percent of the economy. They will be also responsible to raise the price of Nutz after the ICO.


<h2>Structure of our ICO</h2>

The Smart Contract we use for our ICO is a variation of the Safe Token Contract proposed by Vlad Zamfir. A smart contract is essentially a piece of code running on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract will send you Nutz if you in return send Ether to it. After the ICO it will also be able to work the other way around. If you send Nutz to the contract it will return Ether to you (even though less than for what you bought during the ICO). The price at which the contract sells Nutz to you is called the ceiling price. The price at which it buys Nutz from you is called the floor price.
Our goal is to raise 20k in Ether.  For each Ether you send to the contract you will get 100 Nutz in return which equivalates to 2.000.000 Nutz that are given out during the ICO.



<h2>ICO Ending conditons</h2>

1. If we reach the goal of 20k Ether. The ceiling price increases by 30% (discount period over).

2. If after 2 months the funding goal is not reached the investors can claim all of their invested Ether back.

To create an incentive to invest during the ICO and not at a later point in time, the price for Nutz will be increased by (by at least 30%) once the ICO has ended. At the same time this will allow for capital growth once the token is tradable on secondary markets.
Example: During our ICO you invest 60 ETH. In return you receive 6.000 Nutz. The ICO ended and was successful. Now you decide you want to use 3.000 Nutz to play at the table and you convert the other half into ABPs. This converts to a share of 0,3% of the total economy.  
We plan to unlock additional ABPs (up to a max of 80% of the total economy) after we have reached our milestones. See our timeline here.

<h2>One more thing …</h2>

After the ICO not all 20k Ether are immediately at our disposal. Only 25% will be unlocked right away while the Sales Admins will unlock the next chunks only once we reach the next milestones. Notice that after the ICO you will always be able to sell your Nutz for Ether again (at a lower price, will be determined after ICO) to the Safe Token Contract.
