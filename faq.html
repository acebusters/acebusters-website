                                Acebusters uses the Ethereum blockchain to manage player funds. That means you are in complete control of your balance and it is always secure. Our tables are implemented as smart contracts (a piece of code running on the ethereum blockchain), which means that at no point we have any control over the funds that you play with. You will be able to deposit and withdraw any amount at any time within a couple of minutes. 
                                There is no counterparty risk in this model and events like Black Friday are things of the past.

                                After our ICO (Initial Coin Offering) we also aim to implement the Mental Poker Protocol. A cryptographic protocol which allows players in a peer to peer network a guaranteed fairly shuffled game as well as the certainty that no one can peek at your cards. Remember the Ultimate-Bet super user scandal ? This is a thing of the past. 
                            </p>

                                You want to stake a player or buy a share in a tournament but you are uncertain whether the other party can be trusted and not run with the money at some point? Smart contracts can assure that you that you can always retrieve your share from the person you staked.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What currency is used to play at the table ? <h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        We will launch our token (called NUTZ)  on XX.XX.XXX, which is used to play at the table and which you will hold in your account. You will be able to buy the token for ether, the currency of the ethereum blockchain. After a successful ICO our token will be traded on exchanges like any other cryptocurrency and there it can be converted to FIAT currency.    
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">How much will the rake be?<h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        We will figure out the exact amounts during our beta when we have a better idea about the frequency of transactions to the blockchain. But we will use rake only to cover these transactions fees and our general operating costs. The rest will be redistributed to you as an affiliate. So very likely it will be much lower than on any traditional platform.  
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">So how do you make money?<h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Our goal is to generate value solely with our token.  The token will only be valuable if we have an active and vibrant community.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What is this ICO you speak of? <h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        ICO stand for Initial Coin Offering. It is a new way for projects to raise funds leveraging the blockchain technology. It is very well suited for establishing decentralized organizations, which Acebusters aspires to be. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO’s or Dapps) use their own token/currency as part of their application. If you want to know more about the structure of our ICO and how you can participate please read this blog article.  
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">When will the ICO start? <h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        It will start on XX.XX.XXXX and end on XX.XX.XXXX. 
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What do i need to invest in the ICO ? <h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        You will need ether to buy our token.  Once you will send ether to the address you received when you created your account with us you will receive NUTZ in return.  
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What are the next steps?<h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        We have developed a prototype to showcase that our vision is technically feasible today. We are using multi state channels for the real time interactions at the table. If the ICO will be successful the biggest part of the money raised will go into the development for the poker client running on top of our smart contracts. This will include the Mental Poker peer-to-peer implementation as well as different game types like SNGS, MTT, Pot Limit Omaha etc. 
                        We also strive for a UX that will be as good and better as everything that is on the market today. 
                        For next steps please also take a look at our timeline.
