We are happy to announce the next step towards a decentralized online poker platform! The public beta starts now. To participate, please join our Discord channel! You can get your referral code, ask questions and give us feedback.

If you know any friends or peers who also might be interested feel free to share this link: [https://discordapp.com/invite/7PesDTZ](https://discordapp.com/invite/7PesDTZ)

The beta is running on the Ethereum public testnet. That means the game tokens, Nutz (NTZ), are just for testing and have no monetary value for right now! Once you sign up you will automatically receive 1,500 NTZ to play with!
