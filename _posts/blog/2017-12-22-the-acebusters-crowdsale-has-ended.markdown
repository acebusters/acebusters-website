We did not complete our crowdsale. But that doesn't hold us back from moving on!

We would like to **thank you for all your support** for the Acebusters Token Sale. Despite great efforts from you, our supporters and from the whole Acebusters community, unfortunately **we did not reach the minimum goal required** for the Crowdsale to complete.

However, the last two months have been **incredibly exciting**. We made many new contacts, met a lot of new friends, extended our community and generated an immense amount learnings about the Blockchain space and the online poker market. That said, it should be pretty clear that we won't stop here. **We are just getting started!**

Currently we are using of the feedback you have given so far and **prepare a shift with our product strategy** to increase traction, to make it easier for everyone to use Acebusters and to go forward strongly in early 2018. **We are convinced more than ever that the revolution of online poker has just begun.**

Furthermore **we are going to simplify our token model**, and likely we won't be giving out the token during a crowdsale. Specifically, we think of the following ways to receive the NTZ token:

   - 50% of total supply to be given out as prizes in our soon starting freerolls and tournaments.
   - 25% of total supply to be distributed as weekly bounties for community members.

Stay tuned for more updates!
