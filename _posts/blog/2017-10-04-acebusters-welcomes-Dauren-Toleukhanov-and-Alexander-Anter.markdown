As a renowned specialist in international relations and investment banking, **Dauren Toleukhanov** has been the CEO of the Centre of Trade Policy Development of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Deputy Head at the Prime Minister's Office of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Since 2012 he is the director of the Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna and now the Head of its London office.

> “I am very excited to join the Acebusters Advisory Board. With my past experience in investment banking and financial services, I hope to bring a new depth of knowledge to the project. I am very excited to see how the Acebusters team and blockchain technology as a whole will reinvent online poker. This space can and should benefit from more transparency and decentralization.” — Acebusters advisor Dauren Toleukhanov.

With **Alexander Anter**, we are more than happy to win one of Sweden's most popular poker players for the advisory board.

Alex Anter is adding multiple, valuable skills to the advisory board and to the Acebusters team. He is not only WSOP gold bracelet winner and one of Sweden's most popular poker players, he is also entrepreneur, full stack developer, co-founder and CTO of RefToken, a decentralised affiliate platform. As this seems to be the perfect skillset for building the next generation online poker platform, we are proud to have him on board.

> “I love poker and as I have heard that Acebusters is building a decentralised poker platform, I was thrilled by it immediately. I hope that my experience in poker as well as my technical background will help Acebusters to disrupt the online poker market. Additionally, a potential partnership with RefToken could be a huge chance for both parties to strengthen their position in the market.” -- Alexander Anter, Acebusters advisor.

We express our heartfelt gratitude for their advice and are looking forward to collaborate on the future of online poker.
