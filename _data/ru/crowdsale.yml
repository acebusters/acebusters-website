    <span>Introduction of Reserve and <br>
    Escrow Council</span>
  description: >
    The raised Ether will remain fully auditable in the reserve of the Acebusters smart contract after the crowdsale. Withdrawals from the reserve are limited to the Escrow Council, a team of four individuals carefully selected to represent the interests of players and investors. The council can only act by majority vote through a 3-of-4 multi-signature configuration.
    The Acebusters team will apply to the council for milestone payments according to our roadmap one after the other. So without an independent party signing, we will not be able to withdraw reserve funds.

      - p: Up to 30% of the Dapp's Power tokens will be sold in this event. While keeping the bulk of tokens seems unusual, it is of strategic importance for Acebusters growth strategy.
      - p: By raising only as much money as needed the founding team wants to build trust and prove its abilities with the players and investors first. When the expansion to new markets will require more capital we will be able to achieve a better price for the tokens and attract high quality investors in further sales events.
      - p: The team is committed to a sustainable growth path, ready to give up its majority share when the Dapp has developed an effective governance process by its stakeholders.
