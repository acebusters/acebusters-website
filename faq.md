        What are the benefits over a traditional poker platform?
</h2>
<div class="collapse" id="faq1">
    <p class="lead">
        Acebusters uses the Ethereum blockchain to manage players' funds. That means you are in complete control of your balance and it is always secure. Our tables are implemented as smart contracts (a piece of code running on the Ethereum blockchain), which means that at no point we have any control over the funds that you play with. You will be able to deposit and withdraw any amount at any time within a couple of minutes. 
        <br/>
        There is no counterparty risk in this model and comparable to the “black friday” become impossible.

    How much is the rake?
</h2>
<div class="collapse" id="faq3">
    <p class="lead">
        The exact amount of the rake will be determined during the beta phase. The rake will be used exclusively to cover blockchain transactions fees. The remaining amount will instantly be redistributed to the affiliates. Hence, the rake will be much lower than on any traditional platform.

        Can I be an affiliate?
</h2>
<div class="collapse" id="faq7">
    <p class="lead">
        Anyone can be an affiliate. Once you sign up you will get a referral code which you can send to your friends and peers. You will earn the lion's share of their produced rake.

        What are smart contracts?
</h2>
<div class="collapse" id="faq4">
    <p class="lead">    
        A smart contract is a piece of code running on the Ethereum blockchain.
        <br>
        Assume you want to stake another player or buy a share in a tournament but you are uncertain whether the other party can be trusted. Smart contracts can ensure that you will always be able to retrieve your share from the person you staked.

</h2>

    <p class="lead">
        The Mental Poker Protocol is a technology which allows players in a peer to peer network a guaranteed fairly shuffled game as well as the certainty that no one can peek at your cards. Remember the Ultimate-Bet super user scandal? This is a thing of the past.
