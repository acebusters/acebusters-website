<div class="collapse" id="faq1">
  <p class="lead">
    Users control their bankroll using a wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts secure the stakes at the tables. There is no counterparty risk therefore and events comparable to "Black Friday" become impossible.

<h2 role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq2" class="faq-header">How much is the rake?</h2>
<div class="collapse" id="faq2">
  <p class="lead">
    The exact amount of the rake will be determined during the beta phase. The rake will be used exclusively to cover blockchain transaction fees. The remaining amount will be redistributed instantly to the affiliates. Hence the rake will be much lower than on any traditional platform.

<h2 role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq3" class="faq-header">Who can be an affiliate?</h2>
<div class="collapse" id="faq3">
  <p class="lead">
    Anyone can be an affiliate. Once signed up, you will get a referral code which can be used to refer friends and peers. The referrer will earn the lion's share of the referee's rake.

<h2 role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq4" class="faq-header">What are smart contracts?</h2>
<div class="collapse" id="faq4">
  <p class="lead">    
    A smart contract is a piece of code running on the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br>
    Assume you want to stake another player or buy a share in a tournament but you are uncertain whether the other party can be trusted. Smart contracts ensure that you will always be able to retrieve your share from the person you staked.

<div class="collapse" id="faq5">
  <p class="lead">
    The Mental Poker Protocol is a technology which allows players in a peer to peer network a guaranteed fairly shuffled game as well as the certainty that no one can peek at your cards. Remember the Ultimate-Bet super user scandal? This is a thing of the past.

<div class="collapse" id="faq6">
  <p class="lead">
    We have developed a prototype to showcase that our vision is technically feasible today. We are using payment channels for the real-time interactions at the table. Our next goal is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker">Mental Poker</a> protocol implementation as well as different game types like SNGS, MTT, Pot Limit Omaha etc.
